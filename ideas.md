A list of open ideas.

* Support globs in require statements so you can easily bundle static assets etc. Webpack-dev-server should monitor the glob for new files.
* Allow defining plugins in the webpack configuration file so you don't need an extra file for trivial custom loaders
* Allow adding command line parameters to the webpack CLI from the configuration file so it's easier to change the webpack configuration inside the configuration file.
