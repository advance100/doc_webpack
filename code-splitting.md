For big web apps it's not efficient to put all code into a single file, especially if some blocks of code are only required under some circumstances.
webpack has a feature to split your codebase into "chunks" which are loaded on demand. Some other bundlers call them "layers", "rollups", or "fragments". This feature is called "code splitting". 

It's an opt-in feature. You can define split points in your code base. webpack takes care of the dependencies, output files and runtime stuff.

To clarify a common misunderstanding: Code Splitting is not just about extracting common code into a shared chunk. The more notable feature is that Code Splitting can be used to split code into an **on demand** loaded chunk. This can keep the initial download small and downloads code on demand when requested by the application.



## Defining a split point

AMD and CommonJs specify different methods to load code on demand. Both are supported and act as split points:

### `require.ensure` (CommonJs)

``` javascript
require.ensure(dependencies, callback)
```

The `require.ensure` method ensures that every dependency in `dependencies` can be synchronously required when calling the `callback`. `callback` is called with the `require` function as parameter.

Example:

``` javascript
require.ensure(["module-a", "module-b"], function(require) {
	var a = require("module-a");
	// ...
});
```

Note: `require.ensure` only loads the modules, it doesn't evaluate them.

### `require` (AMD)

The AMD spec defines an asynchronous `require` method with this definition:

``` javascript
require(dependencies, callback)
```

When called all `dependencies` are loaded and the `callback` is called with the exports of the loaded `dependencies`.

Example:

``` javascript
require(["module-a", "module-b"], function(a, b) {
	// ...
});
```

Note: AMD `require` loads and evaluate the modules. In webpack modules are evaluated left to right.

Note: It's allowed to omit the callback.



## Chunk content

All dependencies at a split point go into a new chunk. Dependencies are also recursively added.

If you pass a function expression (or bound function expression) as callback to the split point, webpack automatically puts all dependencies required in this function expression into the chunk too.



## Chunk optimization

If two chunks contain the same modules, they are merged into one. This can cause chunks to have multiple parents.

If a module is available in all parents of a chunk, it's removed from that chunk.

If a chunk contains all modules of another chunk, this is stored. It fulfill multiple chunks.



## Chunk loading

Depending on the configuration option `target` a runtime logic for chunk loading is added to the bundle. I. e. for the `web` target chunks are loaded via jsonp. A chunk is only loaded once and parallel requests are merged into one. The runtime checks for loaded chunks whether they fulfill multiple chunks.



## Chunk types

### Entry chunk

An entry chunk contains the runtime plus a bunch of modules. If the chunk contains the module `0` the runtime executes it. If not, it waits for chunks that contains the module `0` and executes it (every time when there is a chunk with a module `0`).

### Normal chunk

A normal chunk contains no runtime. It only contains a bunch of modules. The structure depends on the chunk loading algorithm. I. e. for jsonp the modules are wrapped in a jsonp callback function. The chunk also contains a list of chunk id that it fulfills.

### Initial chunk (non-entry)

An initial chunk is a normal chunk. The only difference is that optimization threads it as more important because it counts toward the initial loading time (like entry chunks). That chunk type can occur in combination with the `CommonsChunkPlugin`.



## Split app and vendor code

To split your app into 2 files, say `app.js` and `vendor.js`, you can `require` the vendor files in `vendor.js`. Then pass this name to the `CommonsChunkPlugin` as shown below.

``` javascript
module.exports = {
  entry: {
    app: "./app.js",
    vendor: ["jquery", "underscore", ...],
  },
  output: {
    filename: "bundle.js"
  },
  plugins: [
    new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin(/* chunkName= */"vendor", /* filename= */"vendor.bundle.js")
  ]
};
```

This will remove all modules in the `vendor` chunk from the `app` chunk. The `bundle.js` will now contain just your app code, without any of it's dependencies. These are in `vendor.bundle.js`.

In your HTML page load `vendor.bundle.js` before `bundle.js`.

``` html
<script src="vendor.bundle.js"></script>
<script src="bundle.js"></script>
```



## Multiple entry chunks

It's possible to [[configure | configuration]] multiple entry points that will result in multiple entry chunks. The entry chunk contains the runtime and there must only be one runtime on a page (there are exceptions).

### Running multiple entry points

With the `CommonsChunkPlugin` the runtime is moved to the commons chunk. The entry points are now in initial chunks. While only one entry chunk can be loaded, multiple initial chunks can be loaded. This exposes the possibility to run multiple entry points in a single page.

Example:

``` javascript
{
	entry: { a: "./a", b: "./b" },
	output: { filename: "[name].js" },
	plugins: [ new webpack.CommonsChunkPlugin("init.js") ]
}
```

``` html
<script src="init.js"></script>
<script src="a.js"></script>
<script src="b.js"></script>
```



## Commons chunk

The `CommonsChunkPlugin` can move modules that occur in multiple entry chunks to a new entry chunk (the commons chunk). The runtime is moved to the commons chunk too. This means the old entry chunks are initial chunks now. See all options in the [[list of plugins]].



## Optimization 

There are optimizing plugins that can merge chunks depending on specific criteria. See [[list of plugins]].

* `LimitChunkCountPlugin`
* `MinChunkSizePlugin`
* `AggressiveMergingPlugin`



## Named chunks

The `require.ensure` function accepts an additional 3rd parameter. This must be a string. If two split point pass the same string they use the same chunk.



## `require.include`

``` javascript
require.include(request)
```

`require.include` is a webpack specific function that adds a module to the current chunk, but doesn't evaluate it (The statement is removed from the bundle).

Example:

``` javascript
require.ensure(["./file"], function(require) {
  require("./file2");
});

// is equals to

require.ensure([], function(require) {
  require.include("./file");
  require("./file2");
});
```

`require.include` can be useful if a module is in multiple child chunks. A `require.include` in the parent would include the module and the instances of the modules in the chunk chunks would disappear.
