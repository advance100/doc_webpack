## optimize

#### `webpack/lib/optimize/CommonsChunkPlugin(filename, [entryPoints], [minChunks])`

``` html
<script src="commons.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<script src="entry.bundle.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

`filename` the filename of the commons chunk (like `output.filename`). Accepts `[hash]`, `[chunkhash]`, etc.

`entryPoints` an array of entry points that should be used to generate these commons chunk. By default all entry points will be used.

`minChunks` the number of entry point that need to have a module in common. By default it need to be in all entry points. Allowed values are >= 2, <= entry points count.
