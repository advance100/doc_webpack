# What are loaders?

Loaders are transformations that are applied on a resource file of your app. They are functions (running in node.js) that take the source of a resource file are parameter and return new source.

## Loader features

* Loaders can be chained. They are applied in a pipeline to the resource. The final loader is expected to return javascript, the other can return arbitrary format (which is passed to the next loader)
* Loaders can be synchronous and asynchronous.
* Loaders run in node.js and can do everything thats possible there.
* Loaders accept query parameters. This can be used to pass configuration to the loader.
* Loaders can be bound to extension / RegExps in the configuration.
* Loaders can be published / installed through `npm`.
* Normal modules can export a loader in addition to the normal `main` via `package.json` `loader`.
* Loaders can access the configuration.
* Plugins can give loaders more features.
* Loaders can emit additional arbitrary files.

# Resolving loaders

Loaders are [[resolved similar to modules | resolving]]. A loader module is expected to export a function and to be written in node.js compatible javascript. In the common case you manage loaders with npm, but you can also have loaders as files in your app.

## Referencing loaders

By convention, though not required, loaders are usually named as `XXX-loader`, where `XXX` is the context name. For example, `json-loader`. 

You may reference loaders by its full (actual) name (e.g. `json-loader`), or by its shorthand name (e.g. `json`). 

The loader name convention and precedence search order is defined by [`resolveLoader.moduleTemplates`](http://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#resolveloader-moduletemplates) within the webpack configuration API. 

Loader name conventions may be useful, especially when referencing them within `require()` statements; see usage below.

## Installing loaders

If the loader is available on npm you can install the loader via:

``` sh
$ npm install xxx-loader --save
```

or

``` sh
$ npm install xxx-loader --save-dev
```
# Usage

There are multiple ways to use loaders in your app:

* explicit in the `require` statement
* configured via configuration
* configured via CLI

## loaders in `require`

> **Note:** Avoid using this, if at all possible, if you intend your scripts to be environment agnostic (node.js and browser). Use the *configuration* convention for specifying loaders (see next section).

It's possible to specify the loaders in the `require` statement (or `define`, `require.ensure`, etc.). Just separate loaders from resource with `!`. Each part is resolved relative to the current directory.

``` javascript
require("./loader!./dir/file.txt");
// => uses the file "loader.js" in the current directory to transform
//    "file.txt" in the folder "dir".

require("jade!./template.jade");
// => uses the "jade-loader" (that is installed from npm to "node_modules")
//    to transform the file "template.jade"

require("style!css!less!bootstrap/less/bootstrap.less");
// => the file "bootstrap.less" in the folder "less" in the "bootstrap"
//    module (that is installed from github to "node_modules") is
//    transformed by the "less-loader". The result is transformed by the
//    "css-loader" and than by the "style-loader".
```


## [[Configuration]]

You can bind loaders to a RegExp via configuration:

``` javascript
{
	module: {
		loaders: [
			{ test: /\.jade$/, loader: "jade" },
			// => "jade" loader is used for ".jade" files

			{ test: /\.css$/, loader: "style!css" },
			// => "style" and "css" loader is used for ".css" files
			// Alternative syntax:
			{ test: /\.css$/, loaders: ["style", "css"] },
		]
	}
}
```

## [[CLI]]

You can bind loaders to a extension via CLI:

``` sh
$ webpack --module-bind jade --module-bind css=style!css
```

This uses the loader "jade" for ".jade" files and the loaders "style" and "css" for ".css" files.

## Query parameters

Loader can be passed query parameters via a query string (just like in the web). The query string is appended to the loader with `?`. I. e. `url-loader?mimetype=image/png`.

Note: The format of the query string is up to the loader. See format in the loader documentation. The most loaders accept parameters in the normal query format (`?key=value&key2=value2`) and as JSON object (`?{"key":"value","key2":"value2"}`).

### in `require`

``` javascript
require("url-loader?mimetype=image/png!./file.png");
```

### Configuration

``` javascript
{ test: /\.png$/, loader: "url-loader?mimetype=image/png" }
```

or

``` javascript
{
	test: /\.png$/,
	loader: "url-loader"
	query: { mimetype: "image/png" }
}
```


### CLI

``` sh
webpack --module-bind "png=url-loader?mimetype=image/png"
```
