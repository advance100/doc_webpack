To use hot code replacement with webpack you need to four things:

* records (`--records-path`, `recordsPath: ...`)
* global enable hot code replacement (`--hot`, `hot: true`)
* hot replacement code in your code `module.hot.accept`
* hot replacement management code in your code `module.hot.check`, `module.hot.apply`

A small testcase:

``` css
/* style.css */
body {
  background: red;
}
```

``` javascript
/* entry.js */
require("./style.css");
document.write("<input type='text' />");
```

That's enough to use hot code replacement with the dev-server.

``` sh
npm install webpack webpack-dev-server -g
npm install webpack css-loader style-loader
webpack-dev-server webpack/hot/dev-server ./entry --hot --module-bind "css=style!css"
```

The dev server provides in memory records, which is good for development.

There is special management code for the dev-server at `webpack/hot/dev-server`.

The `style-loader` already includes hot replacement code.

If you visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) you should see the page with a red background and a input box. Type some text into the input box and edit `style.css` to have another background color. 

Voil√†... The background updates but without full page refresh. Text and selection in the input box should stay.
