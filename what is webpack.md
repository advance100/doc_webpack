**webpack** is a **module bundler**.test

webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.

## Why another module bundler?

Existing module bundlers are not well suited for big projects (big single page application). The most pressing reason for developing another module bundler was [[Code Splitting]] and that static assets should fit seamlessly together through modularization.

I tried to extend existing module bundlers, but it wasn't possible to achieve all goals.

## Goals

* Split the dependency tree into chunks loaded on demand
* Keep initial loading time low
* Every static asset should be able to be a module
* Ability to integrate 3rd-party libraries as modules
* Ability to customize nearly every part of the module bundler
* Suited for big projects

## How webpack is different?

#### [[Code Splitting]]

webpack has two types of dependencies in it's dependency tree: sync and async. Async dependencies act as split points and form a new chunk. After the chunk tree is optimized, a file is emitted for each chunk.

#### [[Loaders]]

webpack can only process javascript natively, but loaders are used to transform other resources into javascript. By doing so every resource forms a module.

#### Clever parsing

webpack has a clever parser that can process nearly every 3rd party library. It even allows expressions in dependencies like so `require("./templates/" + name + ".jade")`. It handles the most common module styles: [[CommonJs]] and [[AMD]].

#### [[Plugin system | plugins]]

webpack features a rich plugin system. Most internal features are based on this plugin system. This allows you to customize webpack for your needs and distribute common plugins as open source.
